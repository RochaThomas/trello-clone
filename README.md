# Trello Clone
This Trello Clone project was created using the MERN stack (React frontend with a MongoDB, NodeJS, Express backend). The focus of this project was mostly the frontend as we attempted to model design after the actual Trello application. We also built a fully functioning backend for the features we decided to incorporate, allowing us to familiarize ourselves with the entirety of the MERN stack. As the real Trello is a fully functioning free resource, I decided not to deploy this project. However, if you wish to have a more hands-on view of our project, feel free to click on the image below which will take you to a video demonstration on YouTube.
